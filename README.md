# Data-Incubator
The Data Incubator Challenge

As a semifinalist, I would like to propose a project I would like to work on if selected. While analyzing the data for Problem 2, I realized that there has not been any decline in the number of traffic violations over the past 2 decades. In fact, there has been an increase in the number of violations. So, I would like to further analyze the data to find patterns in the traffic violations which might help to reduce them over time. Some of the preliminary results are shown below.
